### Setup

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

- 'node caps.js'
- 'node vendor.js'
- 'node driver.js'

#### Tests

ran the caps and vendor services along with the driover and noted the results. To be sure they were handling cases, I made two more vendors with different names and ran those through caps as well.
